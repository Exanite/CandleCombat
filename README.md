# Candle Combat: The Spirit of Wick

Created by Alex, Andrew, Luke, Michael, and William for the DevLUp Fall 2022 Game Jam. \
The theme for the jam was "Just Pick One". 

The game can be found [here on itch.io](https://fablefox5.itch.io/candle-combat).

## Description

Play as John Wick's soul, a fiery flame with a burning desire to take control of candles!  Fight an endless onslaught of candles who desperately try to blow out your flame.  However, make sure to pick your targets wisely and accurately, or you may end up melting into defeat.

Survive as long as possible fighting against an endless wave of enemies. Melt (kill) enemies by shooting them and using your fire ability. However if you get hit by the wind (projectiles), your health will decrease, and your flame will dim and you must transfer your soul before you are burnt out. As you are playing, your own flame will melt your candle, causing your health to decrease. Also be aware that using your fire ability will cause your health to decrease and cause your candle to melt. You must multitask attacking enemies with your gun, using abilities, and managing your melting health by transferring your soul to other candles in order to survive.
